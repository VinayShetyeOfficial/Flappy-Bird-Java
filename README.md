# Flappy-Bird-Java
A simple recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Java and Swing. The game features smooth animation, collision detection, and simple gameplay mechanics where the player controls a bird to navigate through pipes. Great for learning Java GUI programming and game development basics!
